# Android Giphy Client
An example project for using Kotlin, rxJava, Anko, Dagger and many other libraries in an Andorid app. 

Learning it all and trying to come up with a decent architecture that could scale to real apps as I go along.

The first few commits could be especially useful for anyone trying to get Kotlin, rxJava, Anko and Dagger setup for the first time.
